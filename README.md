# Physical Design with OpenLane using SKY130 PDK
## Table of Contents

## Introduction
With the advent of open-source technologies for Chip development, there were several RTL designs, EDA Tools which were open-sourced. The missing piece in a complete Open source chip development was filled by the [SKY130 PDK](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules.html) from Skywater Technologies and Google.  There were several EDA Tools, which played specfic roles in the design cycle. There was not a clean design flow and Skywater pdk was compatible with only the industrty tools.  [OpenLane](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane) addressed these issues in providing a completely automated and clean RTL to GDSII flow. OpenLane is not a tool, but a flow which consists of several EDA tools, automation scripts and Skywater-pdks tuned to work specifically with the open-source EDA tools.     

## Overall Design Flow
For a design Specification an RTL Design is written in HDLs like Verilog /VHDL or RTL Design is generated using Hardware Construction Languages like Chisel or High Level Synthesis using  SystemC, MATLAB HDL Coder, Bluespec etc or a modern abstraction level called [TL-Verilog](makerchip.com) (its not a HDL/HLS) , specified by TL-x.org.
After this begins the workflow of taking the RTL Netlist into a fabricated IC, which is called as Physical Design Flow.

Physical Design begins with Floor planning - placing the preplaced cells, power planning etc., secondly Placement of Logical Synthesis. Now we do CTS (Clock Tree Synthesis) such there the skew of the clock is the minimum or within the required threshold. After CTS, Routing is done to route all the components placed. Between each and every step that happens in the physical design flow starting from Logic Synthesis to routing, a procedure called "Static Timing Analysis" is done to analyse the design at every step to ensure the actual correctness of the design.  To view every stage, Magic is an open source tool to view the layouts. A small netlist can be extracted and a SPICE Simulation can be performed and compared with the Post Layout Simulation using ngspice.
